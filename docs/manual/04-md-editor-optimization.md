## 4.2 Keyboard Shortcuts

The home-page editor (`MemoEditor`) is built on CodeMirror 6 and provides
Notion / Obsidian–style formatting shortcuts. Throughout this page, **`Mod`**
means **`Cmd` on macOS** and **`Ctrl` on Windows / Linux**.

- **Command catalog:** `web/src/components/MemoEditor/formatting/commands.ts` —
  shared by both the toolbar buttons and the shortcuts, so a single command
  definition drives both.
- **Execution & keymap:**
  `web/src/components/MemoEditor/Editor/formatting.ts` — `applyCommand` runs a
  formatting command; `createFormattingKeymap` binds the keys.
- **Wiring:** `web/src/components/MemoEditor/Editor/extensions.ts` feeds
  `createFormattingKeymap()` into CodeMirror's `keymap.of([...])`.
- **Editor-level shortcuts:**
  `web/src/components/MemoEditor/hooks/useKeyboard.ts` — global keys at the
  editor level (currently just `Mod-Enter` to save).

## 4.1 Supported shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Mod-Enter` | Publish / save memo | Requires the editor to be focused. |
| `Mod-B` | Bold `**text**` | Toggles off when the cursor is already inside bold text. |
| `Mod-I` | Italic `*text*` | Toggles, same as above. |
| `Mod-E` | Inline code `` `text` `` | Toggles, same as above. |
| `Mod-K` | Insert / remove link `[text](url)` | With the cursor already inside a link, it expands back to plain text; when creating a new link you fill in the URL manually (the toolbar button behaves the same — there is no URL input popover yet). |
| `Mod-Shift-7` | Ordered list | Applies to all selected lines at once. |
| `Mod-Shift-8` | Bulleted list | Same as above. |
| `Mod-Shift-9` | Task list `- [ ]` | Same as above. |
| `Mod-Alt-0` | Body text (clear heading) | |
| `Mod-Alt-1` / `Mod-Alt-2` / `Mod-Alt-3` | Heading 1 / 2 / 3 | Matches the toolbar's addressable range (H1–H3). |
| `Mod-Alt-4` / `Mod-Alt-5` | Heading 4 / 5 | Shortcut-only; not wired into the command catalog (`EditorCommandId` stops at heading3), so the toolbar and active-state highlight won't show H4/H5 — but the rendering and Markdown output are correct. |
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Indent / outdent list item | Pre-existing, not added in this pass. |
| `Escape` | Blur the editor | Pre-existing, not added in this pass. |
| `Mod-Z` / `Mod-Shift-Z` | Undo / redo | Comes from CodeMirror's `historyKeymap`. |

## 4.2 Not supported (intentionally deferred)

The Notion / Obsidian formats below have no toggle logic in the current
Markdown command catalog (`formatting/commands.ts`) yet, so they were left out
to avoid introducing new formatting capabilities that haven't been confirmed
with the product:

- Strikethrough (`~~text~~`)
- Underline
- Highlight / mark (`==text==`)
- Blockquote (`> `)
- Fenced code block (```` ``` ````)

To add one, you first extend `formatting/commands.ts` with the matching
`EditorCommandId` and `ActiveFormatState` field, implement the toggle in
`Editor/formatting.ts` (following the existing `toggleMark` / `toggleListLine`),
and then register the key binding in `createFormattingKeymap`.

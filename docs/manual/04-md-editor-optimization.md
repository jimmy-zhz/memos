## 4.2 Keyboard Shortcuts

The home-page editor (`MemoEditor`) is built on CodeMirror 6 and provides
Notion / Obsidian–style formatting shortcuts. Throughout this page, **`Mod`**
means **`Cmd` on macOS** and **`Ctrl` on Windows / Linux**.

- **Command catalog:** `web/src/components/MemoEditor/formatting/commands.ts` —
  shared by both the toolbar buttons and the shortcuts, so a single command
  definition drives both.
- **Execution & keymap:**
  `web/src/components/MemoEditor/Editor/formatting.ts` — `applyCommand` runs a
  formatting command; `createFormattingKeymap` binds the keys.
- **Wiring:** `web/src/components/MemoEditor/Editor/extensions.ts` feeds
  `createFormattingKeymap()` into CodeMirror's `keymap.of([...])`.
- **Editor-level shortcuts:**
  `web/src/components/MemoEditor/hooks/useKeyboard.ts` — global keys at the
  editor level (currently just `Mod-Enter` to save).

## 4.1 Supported shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Mod-Enter` | Publish / save memo | Requires the editor to be focused. |
| `Mod-B` | Bold `**text**` | Toggles off when the cursor is already inside bold text. |
| `Mod-I` | Italic `*text*` | Toggles, same as above. |
| `Mod-E` | Inline code `` `text` `` | Toggles, same as above. |
| `Mod-K` | Insert / remove link `[text](url)` | With the cursor already inside a link, it expands back to plain text; when creating a new link you fill in the URL manually (the toolbar button behaves the same — there is no URL input popover yet). |
| `Mod-Shift-7` | Ordered list | Applies to all selected lines at once. |
| `Mod-Shift-8` | Bulleted list | Same as above. |
| `Mod-Shift-9` | Task list `- [ ]` | Same as above. |
| `Mod-Shift-0` | Insert checked task `- [x] ` | Inserts directly at the cursor; not a toggle and not wired into the command catalog. |
| `Mod-Alt-0` | Body text (clear heading) | |
| `Mod-Alt-1` / `Mod-Alt-2` / `Mod-Alt-3` | Heading 1 / 2 / 3 | Matches the toolbar's addressable range (H1–H3). |
| `Mod-Alt-4` / `Mod-Alt-5` | Heading 4 / 5 | Shortcut-only; not wired into the command catalog (`EditorCommandId` stops at heading3), so the toolbar and active-state highlight won't show H4/H5 — but the rendering and Markdown output are correct. |
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Indent / outdent list item | Pre-existing, not added in this pass. |
| `Escape` | Blur the editor | Pre-existing, not added in this pass. |
| `Mod-Z` / `Mod-Shift-Z` | Undo / redo | Comes from CodeMirror's `historyKeymap`. |

## 4.2 Not supported (intentionally deferred)

The Notion / Obsidian formats below have no toggle logic in the current
Markdown command catalog (`formatting/commands.ts`) yet, so they were left out
to avoid introducing new formatting capabilities that haven't been confirmed
with the product:

- Strikethrough (`~~text~~`)
- Underline
- Blockquote (`> `)
- Fenced code block (```` ``` ````)

Highlight (`==text==` / `===text===`) is a partial exception: the Markdown
syntax itself renders (see [4.4](#44-highlight)), it just has no toolbar
button or keyboard shortcut to insert/toggle it yet — you type the `=`
delimiters by hand.

To add one, you first extend `formatting/commands.ts` with the matching
`EditorCommandId` and `ActiveFormatState` field, implement the toggle in
`Editor/formatting.ts` (following the existing `toggleMark` / `toggleListLine`),
and then register the key binding in `createFormattingKeymap`.

## 4.3 Frontmatter properties

A document can open with an Obsidian-style YAML frontmatter block — a `---`
line, one `key: value` line per property, and a closing `---` line — before
the Markdown body:

```markdown
---
title: AI Ethics Week 1
tags: [ai, ethics]
status: completed
date: 2026-07-11
---

# body starts here
```

- **Parser:** `web/src/utils/frontmatter.ts` (`parseFrontmatter`) — line-based,
  not a full YAML engine. Frontmatter must be the very first thing in the
  document. Only flat scalar/list values are recognised (Obsidian's subset);
  nested maps, arrays of objects, and malformed lines are silently ignored and
  never rendered.
- **Supported value types:** `text`, `list` (`[a, b, c]`), `number`, `checkbox`
  (`true` / `false`), `date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`), `datetime`.
- **Rendering:** `web/src/components/MemoContent/PropertiesPanel.tsx` shows the
  parsed properties as a read-only key/value panel above the body — this panel
  never writes back to the document; editing a property means editing the raw
  frontmatter text.

Properties are free-form — you can add any key. Two keys are reserved and
change editor/viewer behavior instead of just being displayed:

| Key | Type | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `displayOutline` | checkbox | `displayOutline: false` collapses the document outline sidebar by default when the document is opened (see `web/src/components/Notebook/DocumentView.tsx`). Any other value, or omitting the key, falls back to the normal viewport-based default (collapsed on narrow screens, expanded on desktop). |
| `hidden` | checkbox | `hidden: true` hides the properties panel itself from the rendered document (see `PropertiesPanel.tsx`). The properties are still parsed and still take effect (e.g. `displayOutline` keeps working) — only the visual key/value list is suppressed. |

```markdown
---
displayOutline: false
hidden: true
---

# body starts here
```

---

## 4.4 Highlight

Two Obsidian-flavored inline highlight delimiters are supported in rendered
Markdown:

| Syntax | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `==text==` | `text` on a light yellow background |
| `===text===` | `text` on a light pink background (this project's own extension — not part of Obsidian) |

```markdown
This is ==important== and this is ===also important, differently===.
```

- **Parser:** `web/src/utils/remark-plugins/remark-highlight.ts` — a remark
  plugin that scans text nodes left to right, preferring the longer `===`
  delimiter so `===text===` isn't misread as `=` + `==text==` + `=`. A bare
  run of `=` (e.g. `====`) or an empty pair never opens a highlight, and
  content inside inline code / fenced code blocks is left untouched (the
  plugin only rewrites plain `text` mdast nodes).
- **Rendering:** the plugin emits a `<mark class="highlight highlight-yellow">`
  / `<mark class="highlight highlight-pink">` node; `MemoMarkdownRenderer.tsx`
  maps `mark` to Tailwind background classes (with dark-mode variants).
  `rehype-sanitize`'s schema (`MemoContent/constants.ts`) explicitly allows the
  `mark` tag and its `className`.
- **No editor shortcut yet:** unlike bold/italic/strikethrough, there's no
  toolbar button or keyboard toggle for highlight — type the `=` delimiters
  directly in the editor. See the note in [4.2](#42-not-supported-intentionally-deferred).
